# Can Machine Learning Models Recognise Emotions Better Than Humans?

This is my final year BSc Computer Science project which aims to explore how human classifiers and SOTA ML models perform in the domain of emotion recognition. We explore how both perform with audio-only and video-only data.

Unfortunately I was unable to complete my initially chosen project (focusing on comparing multimodal ML models) as the dataset I required was unavailable. This resulted in 3 months work being lost.
